Facilitated Escape is a 2D game with a retro feel, based around escaping from a collapsing facility in your rocket. The challenge comes from dodging and weaving between oncoming "blocks". Everything is procedurally generated, so every play is different (and you can never *actually* escape).

You can get more information over at its [page on my website](http://nova-fusion.com/games/facilitated-escape/).

Finally, the game is currently at version 1.0.

## Ludum Dare

The original version was created in less than 48 hours for the 21st [Ludum Dare competition](http://www.ludumdare.com). The theme for this competition was "escape", hence the theme surrounding this game. If you'd like to see the source for the game that was submitted, take a look at the [`compo-submission` tag](https://github.com/BlackBulletIV/facilitated-escape/tree/compo-submission).

I also made a timelapse of all the work I did during the competition (around 18.5 hours), which can view [on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mFjpDqBEPE).

* [Pixen](https://github.com/philippec/Pixen) - Pixel editor to make the art.
* [GarageBand](http://www.apple.com/au/ilife/garageband/) - Used to make the music track. I used [Magical 8bit Plug](http://www.ymck.net/magical8bitplug/index.html) to create the 8-bit tones.
